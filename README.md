# hennery

hennery is a self-hosted cockpit for coding agents. It lets one developer drive
[Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (ACP) sessions — Claude
Code, Codex, or any other ACP adapter — running on any of their machines, from a
single browser tab or a phone. It also includes an MCP gateway: connect a
server once, then choose its hat and the hosts whose sessions may use it.

hennery never proxies agent licences. You bring your own subscriptions and log in
to each agent CLI on your own machines; hennery only drives the sessions.

## Status

**Early testing.** hennery is ready for early testers who build it from
source. There are no published releases, installers or images yet, and stored
data may not survive an upgrade: expect things to change.

What works:

- **Sessions from the browser.** The collector serves its web UI from the
  binary. From it you start Claude Code and Codex sessions on a connected,
  paired machine, prompt them, answer their permission requests, and park
  and resume them.
- **Hats.** Path rules put each session in a hat by its project directory,
  for organising sessions and choosing their MCP servers.
- **MCP servers.** Connect a server with a static token through the gateway,
  or configure local stdio servers for a host and hat, on the **MCP** screen.

Known limitations:

- One owner per collector. Setup requires a password; it also offers a
  passkey, which you can use to sign in afterwards.
- Web Push is built on the collector, but the web UI has no subscribe
  button yet.
- Codex sessions get MCP without per-hat isolation and also load the user's own `~/.codex` MCP servers, until per-hat isolation lands.
- **TODO (4e-ii-b):** OAuth is built on the collector; the browser's OAuth Connect flow is pending.
- The designs are in [`docs/specs/`](docs/specs/) and the plans in
  [`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/); [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) lists
  them.

## Quickstart

You need [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/) with flakes enabled, and on
every machine that runs agents, the CLI for each agent you want to use
already logged in with your own subscription. The flake supports Apple
Silicon macOS, and x86_64 and aarch64 Linux.

### 1. Build

Get the source:

<!-- check: clone -->
```sh
git clone https://github.com/marcinwadon/hennery.git
cd hennery
```

Build the web UI, then the binary, which embeds it. The dev shell brings
Rust, Node and pnpm; with direnv, `direnv allow` once and leave out the
`nix develop -c` prefixes. `HENNERY_WEB_REQUIRE=1` makes the build fail if
the web UI was not built first, instead of embedding a placeholder page.

<!-- check: build -->
```sh
nix develop -c pnpm --dir web install --frozen-lockfile
nix develop -c pnpm --dir web build
HENNERY_WEB_REQUIRE=1 nix develop -c cargo build --release --locked -p hennery
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```

Or let Nix build the whole package:

<!-- check: nix -->
```sh
nix build
./result/bin/hennery --version
```

The binary is then `result/bin/hennery`; put that directory on your `PATH`
instead.

### 2. Start

<!-- check: up -->
```sh
hennery up
```

`hennery up` runs the collector and a host for this machine, and pairs the
two. It listens on `http://127.0.0.1:7117` and keeps its data in
`~/Library/Application Support/hennery` (macOS) or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/hennery`,
by default `~/.local/share/hennery` (Linux). The first start downloads Node
and the managed adapter set, including its bundled agent CLIs.

On its first start it writes a one-time setup link, valid for an hour, to
`collector/setup-url` in the data directory until setup, and prints the link
when running in a terminal. Open that link: by default it uses
`http://localhost:7117`, which is the browser origin to keep using. Choose
and confirm a password of at least 12 characters, check **Public URL** and
**Default hat**, then press **Set up**. You are signed in; add a passkey or
press **Skip** (or **Continue** if passkeys are unavailable). Back up
`collector/master.key` together with `collector/hennery.db`: the gateway's
credentials cannot be read without it.

### 3. Pair another machine

A host on another machine reaches the collector over HTTPS only. `up`
listens on loopback, so put a reverse proxy on the same machine that serves
it at an `https://` address and passes WebSocket upgrades on. If `up` is
already running, stop it with Ctrl-C. Restart it with that address before
setup:

<!-- check: up-public -->
```sh
hennery up --public-url https://hennery.example
```

Already set up at `localhost`? Then `--public-url` is ignored: move it
with `hennery admin reset-public-url` (see [Recovery](#recovery)), and from
then on open hennery at the new address, since the old one is refused.

In the web UI, **Hosts → Add host** shows a pairing code, valid for ten
minutes, and the command that uses it. Build hennery on the other machine,
run that command there (it too downloads the adapters; leave the code out
to type it instead, which keeps it out of your shell history), then start
the host:

<!-- check: join -->
```sh
hennery host join https://hennery.example ABCD-EFGH
```

<!-- check: host-run -->
```sh
hennery host run
```

### 4. Start a session

**New session**: pick a connected host, an agent and a project directory, then
**Start session**, and type your first prompt.

### 5. Connect an MCP server

For a remote server with a static token, open **MCP → Add connection**.
Fill in **Name**, **Slug**, **Server URL** and **Hat**; choose **Token** under
**Authentication**, and set **Header** and **Prefix** as the server requires
(the prefix includes any trailing space). Press **Create**, then enter the
**Token** and press **Save token**. Under **Hosts whose sessions get it**,
tick the hosts to use it; each tick saves immediately. Where delivery is
supported, sessions in that hat on those hosts receive it as
`hennery-<slug>` at their next start or resume.
The status stays **Not used yet** until traffic goes through it.
Use an HTTPS server URL; **Internal network** permits plain HTTP only to
internal addresses, for a server you run there.

For a local stdio server, use **MCP → Local MCP servers**. Choose **Host**
and **Hat**, then **Add local server**. Fill in **Server name** and
**Command** (on that host); use **Add argument** for each argument and
**Add environment variable** for secrets. Press **Review local servers**,
check the commands, then **Save local servers**. Saving replaces the whole
set for that host and hat, including removals, at the next start or resume.
Environment values cannot be read back from hennery.

Agents without per-hat isolation receive hennery MCP servers only in the
host's default hat. Check the delivery prediction beside the host or on
**New session** for the agent you chose; the session reports what it was
given at its last start or resume.

These actions may ask you to confirm your password again.

**TODO (4e-ii-b):** Add the OAuth Connect quickstart after the browser flow merges.

## Recovery

Run these on the collector's machine while hennery runs, as the user that
runs it; each asks for confirmation on the terminal. For a collector not in
the default place, give `--data-dir <dir>` right after `admin`.

- **A forgotten password:** set a new one. It signs out every browser session and
  removes every passkey.

  <!-- check: reset-password -->
  ```sh
  hennery admin reset-password
  ```

- **The collector moved** (another address, or behind a proxy): every
  sign-in and change is refused with `origin_mismatch` until hennery knows
  the address the browser now uses. Give it that origin: `https://`, or
  `http://` to a loopback address, with no path. It signs out every browser
  session; passkeys stop working if the host name changes, and are then
  removed.

  <!-- check: reset-public-url -->
  ```sh
  hennery admin reset-public-url https://hennery.example
  ```
